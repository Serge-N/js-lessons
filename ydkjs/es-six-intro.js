// Js alias ECMAscript
// think of one's js code on feature basis not version
// transpiling (transformation + compiling) use a special tool to transform your new code features into equivalent (or close!) matches that work in older
// environments.
// Polyfills (aka shims) are a pattern for defining equivalent behavior from a newer environment
// into an older environment, when possible.
// Syntax cannot be polyfilled, but APIs often can be.
// So the best strategy for keeping updated as it evolves is to just introduce polyfill shims into your code base, and a transpiler
// step into your build workflow, right now and get used to that new reality
// at the time of writing they exists ES 11.
